{Classification of Moral Reasoning}
{
	We trained a ML algorithm on applied ethics papers corpora for classification of moral reasoning employed in legal text with Prof. Elliott Ash and Prof. Daniel Chen. We used the model to analyse US Circuit Court judge rulings since 1891 and find a phase shift from deontological to consequentialist reasoning.
