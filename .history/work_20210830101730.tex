{Consultant}
{
	I wrote a report on urban design and analytics for disaster impact management with Place Intelligence. I also designed a predicitve framework that can be used to forecast and control for the impacts of disasters such as bush fires.

{ML for Consevation Researcher}
{
	I worked on a joint Project between Microdoft and Department of Planning, Industry and Energy, NSW. We designed an ML model to sift through automatically captured camera trap data to aid environment research and conservation work. I worked on designing an interface for using the model off the shelf.

{Classification of Moral Reasoning}
{
	We trained a ML algorithm on applied ethics papers corpora for classification of moral reasoning employed in legal text with Prof. Elliott Ash and Prof. Daniel Chen. We used the model to analyse US Circuit Court judge rulings since 1891 and find a phase shift from deontological to consequentialist reasoning.
